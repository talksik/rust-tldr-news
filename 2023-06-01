There is a growing concern that a small group of tech companies will exercise near-total control over the technology. A group of academics working in natural language processing has issued the BabyLM Challenge to turn this paradigm on its head. The group is calling for teams to create functional language models using data sets that are less than one-ten-thousandth the size of those used by the most advanced language models.</div></div><div class="mt-3"><a class="font-bold" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/31/openai-is-pursuing-a-new-way-to-fight-ai-hallucinations.html"><h3>OpenAI is pursuing a new way to fight A.I. ‘hallucinations’ (3 minute read)</h3></a><div>OpenAI has developed a new method for training artificial intelligence models that hallucinate less. AI hallucinations occur when large language models fabricate information while behaving as if they are spouting facts. Even state-of-the-art models are prone to hallucinations.

The group is considering creating a 'longevity state' in Rhode Island or somewhere in Latin America. There are no firm plans for the state yet as the organizers want any decisions to be made collaboratively.","date":"2023-06-01","category":"future","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":213828,"url":"https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"Chainlit (GitHub Repo)","tldr":"Chainlit allows users to create ChatGPT-like UIs on top of any Python code.

(7 minute read)","tldr":"Large language models that generate text improve as they are fed more data. Making bigger and more capable AI requires processing power that few companies possess. There is a growing concern that a small group of tech companies will exercise near-total control over the technology. A group of academics working in natural language processing has issued the BabyLM Challenge to turn this paradigm on its head. The group is calling for teams to create functional language models using data sets that are less than one-ten-thousandth the size of those used by the most advanced language models.","date":"2023-06-01","category":"miscellaneous","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":213837,"url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249","title":"Ask HN: Is it just me or GPT-4's quality has significantly deteriorated lately?

AI hallucinations occur when large language models fabricate information while behaving as if they are spouting facts. Even state-of-the-art models are prone to hallucinations. The new training method awards models for each individual correct step of reasoning instead of only rewarding correct final answers. While OpenAI did not invent the approach, it is helping to push it forward.","date":"2023-06-01","category":"miscellaneous","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":213833,"url":"https://info.nexgencloud.com/gpu-asset-class-0","title":"AI Market Cap just increased c$300bn - but infrastructure in short supply (Sponsor)","tldr":"Invest into supercomputers for AI workloads with NVIDIA Partner, NexGen Cloud.
